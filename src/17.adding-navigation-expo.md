# [Expo] Adding navigation with Expo

If you're using Expo, you're in luck. This setup is not nearly as tricky as pure React Native, since Expo have done all the heavy lifting for you. All you need to do is first install the navigation library:

```bash
npm install @react-navigation/native
```

and then all the expo-compatible dependencies:

```bash
expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
```

Finally, open `App.js` and add the following:

```jsx
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';

const App = () => {
  return (<NavigationContainer>{/* Rest of the app code */}</NavigationContainer>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Specifically, you are importing the `NavigationContainer` from the navigation library we just installed, and wrapping the whole application in it. That's it! We're ready to start navigating.

There won't be any UI changes after this change. We're just setting things up for the next step.
