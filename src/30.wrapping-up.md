# Wrapping up

Congrats! You've made it to the end of the course - well done you! üëèüëèüëè

## What you learned

- what is React Native, and what problem is it solving?
- the difference between Expo and plain React Native
- how to debug
- a blazing fast intro to React
- how to style components with StyleSheet and without
- component-based architecture of a React Native application
- how to display lists - FlatList and SectionList
- what navigation options are available for React Native
- [RN] how to install native modules
- react hooks - useState, useEffect, useCallback
- fetch data from network requests
- pull to refresh
- launching modals
- how to build forms

## Where to next

Here are some topics you might want to look into in your own time:

- Animations (honestly it could be a workshop on it's own!): check out the [Animated API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/animations) for pure native animations and [Lottie](https://github.com/react-native-community/lottie-react-native) (a React Native animation library from Airbnb) for pre-made animations
- Images: the built in Image component in React Native is not great, so check out [react-native-fast-image](https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image)
- Bottom tab navigator: most every app has one, but we ran out of time and features. Check out the docs on how to add one [here](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator/)
- `useMemo`: it's another React hook and a handy one. Handy for memoising things. Read more about it [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo)

## Advanced topics

If you're serious about building your own app, here are some more advanced tools and libraries you might want to check out:

- [CodePush](https://github.com/microsoft/code-push): a tool that all allows you to do over the air updates to your deployed app (kind of how the Expo app works, but you'll be in charge!)
- [Detox](https://github.com/wix/Detox): an end to end testing framework for React Native
- [react-native-testing-library](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-testing-library): unit testing library for React Native
- [Fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane): a tool for automating building and releasing your apps

## Wrap up

Again, well done you, thanks so much for taking the course! My goal was to put together the highlights of what you'll need to build an app in React Native and provide you with references to where you can find out the rest. I hope you had fun.

Good luck! Look forward to seeing what you build :)
