# Lists Exercise Solution ðŸ‘€

In this solution we're removed the individual `ColorBoxes` and rendered them all using a `FlatList`. Some things to note:

- since we no longer have a containing `View`, we not pass in the component styles into the `FlatList` component instead. Almost all native components in React Native can by styled using the style prop

- notice that the name of the palette scrolls with the colors. This is because we added it to FlatList using the `ListHeaderComponent` prop

- we've used a little calculation to adjust text colour for the background colour. There are better algorithms to do this, but this is definitely the shortest: `parseInt(props.hexCode.replace('#', ''), 16) > 0xffffff / 1.1`. Here we essentially get the lightest 10% of the background colors and display black text for these, and white for the rest.
